# Jr. UX Developer Challenge!

## Tasks
The client has asked you to create an user experience as a lading page structure, where simplicity and ease-of-use are at the forefront of the design and implementation. Deliver the complete experience using HTML, CSS and JS in Desktop, Tablet and Mobile; you'll receive both desktop and mobile mockups. Provide clear explanations about your decision-making process for the responsive approach; document code as much as possible as well. You can't use CSS frameworks/toolkits nor JS plugins.
 
## Deliverables
* Complete project files working on Chrome, Safari, Firefox and Edge, all of them on the latest version and the previous one.
* Use clean CSS including vendor prefixes if needed.
* Create some basic Jquery interactions (addClass, removeClass, toggleClass).

## Tips
* You can deliver everything else you consider necessary to support your solution.
* Pay special attention to the details.
